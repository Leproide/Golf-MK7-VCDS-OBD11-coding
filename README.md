**BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER:**

- On VW, press and hold MENU button on the display of your MIB2 for 3 seconds and then go to Software Update/Versions and take a look at SW Train string.

- On Audi use corresponding button combo to open RED menu and then look into Versions info

Make sure train starts with MST2 and ends with D. For example: MST2_EU_VW_P0891D. Only in this case, everything below applies to your unit!
